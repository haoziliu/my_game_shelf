Personal project to practice:

**Clean Architecture** - a layered approach that separates your app into domain, data, and presentation, making it easier to test and maintain.

**Jetpack Compose** – Modern, declarative UI toolkit that lets you build interfaces with Kotlin functions instead of XML.

**MVVM** – a pattern that keeps UI logic separate from business logic and data, improving testability.

**Coroutines + Flow** – Kotlin’s lightweight threads (Coroutines) and reactive streams (Flow) for handling asynchronous work and data streams in a concise, non-blocking way.

**Hilt** – Google’s opinionated DI (dependency injection) library for Android, which generates boilerplate code and integrates seamlessly with the Android lifecycle.

**Room** – a persistence library providing an abstraction over SQLite, with compile-time checks and coroutines support for safer, easier local data storage.

**Retrofit** – a type-safe HTTP client that simplifies calling REST APIs by turning endpoints into Kotlin interfaces.

**Coil** – an image loading library built for Kotlin, using coroutines under the hood for efficient, async image loading and caching.

**Unit Testing** – Ensuring code quality and robustness with JUnit, MockK, and Turbine for testing ViewModels, UseCases, and reactive Flow logic.
